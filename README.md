# simple-MNIST-digit-classifier
This project creates a simple digit classfier that takes in an input image of a handwritten digit from 0-9 and identifies it. 
The attached slideshow explains the step by step process to making an algorithm like the classifier and documents the rounds of testing I've done so far. I'm still working on getting the static website working though so there is no link to the website yet
